MOX-fuel-reprocessing=Process for reprocessing used up MOX fuel cells to obtain MOX and research data.
MOX-processing=Mixed oxide (MOX) is obtained by mixing uranium and plutonium to create more powerful fuel cells.
MOX-processing-simple=Mixed oxide (MOX) fuel is obtained by mixing plutonium and depleted uranium. Used up cells contain different isotopes.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=Process for reprocessing used uranium fuel cells to obtain uranium-238, plutonium and research data.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing-simple=Reprocessing used uranium fuel provides uranium ore and fission products.
nuclear-power=Powerful and sophisticated method of power generation using fuel cells.
plutonium-fuel-reprocessing=Process of reprocessing used up plutonium fuel cells to obtain plutonium and research data.
plutonium-processing=Plutonium is obtained from the reprocessing of uranium fuel cells to produce more powerful fuel cells.
thorium-fuel-reprocessing=Process of reprocessing used up thorium fuel cells to obtain thorium and research data.
thorium-processing=Thorium is extracted from uranium ore in a centrifuge to create more powerful fuel cells. (not realistic)

thorium-module-2=A module that supports you in processing- and reprocessing recipes.
thorium-module-3=A module that supports you in processing- and reprocessing recipes.
waste-reprocessing=Process for recycling nuclear waste (not realistic)
uranium-processing-simple=Mined Uranium Ore contains 0.7% Uranium-235 fissile isotope, can be processed into Low-Enriched Uranium (5% U235) and then into Highly Enriched Uranium (90% U235). Depleted Uranium co-product contains almost only inactive Uranium-238.
fissile-products-reprocessing=Recycling fission products, extracting plutonium and useless radioactive waste
kovarex-simple=The process to create Low-Enriched Uranium from Uranium-238. It requires a large amount of Low-Enriched Uranium as a catalyst.
